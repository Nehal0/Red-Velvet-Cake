HOW TO MAKE EGGLESS RED VELVET CAKE
Detailed instructions are included in the printable recipe below (scroll down).

1 — PREPARE THE EQUIPMENT
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Line and grease two 8 or 9-inch (20 or 22-cm) round cake pans.

2 – COMBINE DRY INGREDIENTS
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt into a large bowl; whisk to combine.

3 — CREAM THE BUTTER
In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together butter and sugar until smooth on medium speed. Once smooth add sour cream, vanilla extract, and vinegar; mix till well combined.

4 — COMBINE THE INGREDIENTS
Turn the mixer to low and add the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined.

5 — BAKE THE EGGLESS RED VELVET CAKE
Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 25 – 30 minutes on the same shelf or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let it rest for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool.

6 — ASSEMBLE THE CAKE
To assemble the cake, place 1 cake layer flat side down on a serving platter or cake stand. Spread evenly about 1 cup of frosting onto the cake, using a flat spatula. Place the second cake layer flat side down on top of the first layer. Use remaining frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake, if desired.

QUICK RECIPE TIPS
Measure the ingredients correctly. I highly recommend using a kitchen scale to avoid using too much flour.
Make sure to cream the butter and sugar together for 4 – 5 minutes, until creamy and pale. To achieve this, the butter has to be at the right consistency; ideally, the butter will easily bend without breaking and will give slightly when pressed. If it looks or feels oily is too soft. It should also not look like wet sand. That means it’s not finished creaming yet.
Don’t overmix the batter. Mix just until you’ve evenly distributed the ingredients throughout the batter.
Bake the cake(s) as soon as the batter is ready since you don’t want the baking soda to lose its effectiveness.
The amount of color you need to add depends on the brand of food coloring you are using, add till your batter turns a nice red in color. I used around 1/2 tablespoon. This is the one I always use.
Every oven is different, so baking times always have to be taken with a grain of salt. Oven thermostats can be wildly off, and that will all affect baking time, so keep an eye on yours. The cake(s) are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
